## 🚧 Current Limitations

We are continuously improving VideoLingo, but there are still some limitations:

- Audio Length: Currently only supports videos up to 30 minutes, we plan to extend this limit soon.

- Input Language Support (WhisperX's output of timestamps and punctuation is unstable for some languages):

| Input Language | Support Level | Example Video |
|----------------|---------------|----------------|
| English | 🤩 | [English to Chinese demo](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/127373bb-c152-4b7a-8d9d-e586b2c62b4b) |
| Russian | 😊 | [Russian to Chinese demo](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/25264b5b-6931-4d39-948c-5a1e4ce42fa7) |
| French | 🤩 | [French to Japanese demo](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3ce068c7-9854-4c72-ae77-f2484c7c6630) |
| German | ❓ (Not tested yet) |  |
| Spanish | ❓ (Not tested yet) |  |
| Japanese | 😖 | ❌ |
| Chinese | 😖 | ❌ |

- Output Language Support: VideoLingo supports translation into all languages that Claude can handle
