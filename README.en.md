## üöß Current Limitations and Future Improvements

We are continuously improving VideoLingo, but there are still some limitations:

| Limitation | Current | Plan |
|------------|---------|------|
| Installation Steps | Requires some coding ability and computational resources | Upload Whisper part to Replicate cloud |
| Audio Length | Only supports up to 30 minutes | Will extend this limit soon |
| Multi-language Support | English is more accurate<br>Other languages (e.g., Japanese) need improvement in accuracy | Introduce specialized models for different languages |
