# üè† VideoLingo Local Deployment Guide

VideoLingo offers multiple Whisper solutions for the speech recognition text step (as there's no single perfect choice currently). Choose one based on your personal configuration and needs.

| Solution | Advantages | Disadvantages |
|:---------|:-----------|:--------------|
| **whisper_timestamped** | ‚Ä¢ Runs locally<br>‚Ä¢ Easy installation<br>‚Ä¢ Uses native Whisper model | ‚Ä¢ Ideal for English only<br>‚Ä¢ Requires GPU with 8GB+ VRAM |
| **whisperX**  | ‚Ä¢ Runs locally<br>‚Ä¢ Based on faster-whisper, excellent performance<br>‚Ä¢ Good multi-language support | ‚Ä¢ Requires CUDA and cuDNN installation<br>‚Ä¢ Separate wav2vec model download for each language<br>‚Ä¢ Requires GPU with 8GB+ VRAM |
| **whisperX_api** (üåüRecommended) | ‚Ä¢ Uses Replicate API, no local computing power needed | ‚Ä¢ Replicate service may be unstable, occasional CUDA errors<br>‚Ä¢ large-v3 model used may have inferior punctuation compared to v2 |

## üìã Preparation

1. Obtain the `API_KEY` for `claude-3-5-sonnet`. Recommended affordable channel: [Yunwu API](https://api2.wlai.vip/register?aff=TXMB), only ¬•35/1M, 1/3 of the official price. Of course, you can also use other API providers, but it's recommended to choose `claude-3-5-sonnet` > `Qwen 1.5 72B Chat` > `deepseek-coder`
