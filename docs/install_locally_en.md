# üè† VideoLingo Local Deployment Guide (Windows)

VideoLingo offers multiple Whisper solutions for speech recognition (as there's no single perfect choice currently). Choose one based on your configuration and needs.

| Solution | Advantages | Disadvantages |
|:---------|:-----------|:--------------|
| **whisper_timestamped** | ‚Ä¢ Runs locally<br>‚Ä¢ Easy installation<br>‚Ä¢ Uses native Whisper model | ‚Ä¢ Ideal for English only<br>‚Ä¢ Requires GPU with 8GB+ VRAM |
| **whisperX** (üåüRecommended) | ‚Ä¢ Runs locally<br>‚Ä¢ Based on faster-whisper, excellent performance<br>‚Ä¢ Good multi-language support | ‚Ä¢ Requires CUDA and cuDNN installation<br>‚Ä¢ Separate wav2vec model download for each language<br>‚Ä¢ Requires GPU with 8GB+ VRAM |
| **whisperX_api** | ‚Ä¢ Uses Replicate API, no local computing power needed | ‚Ä¢ Replicate service may be unstable, occasional CUDA errors<br>‚Ä¢ Uses large-v3, punctuation not as good as local v2 |

2. Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/download/win)

3. For `whisperX` users:
   - Install [Cuda Toolkit](https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/12.6.0/local_installers/cuda_12.6.0_560.76_windows.exe)
   - Install [Cudnn](https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cudnn/9.3.0/local_installers/cudnn_9.3.0_windows.exe)
   - Restart your computer after installation

4. For `whisper_timestamped` users:

     - Check "Desktop development with C++" component in the installation interface
   - Install [CMake](https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/releases/download/v3.30.2/cmake-3.30.2-windows-x86_64.msi)

### Installation Steps
