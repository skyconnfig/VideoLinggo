# üè† VideoLingo Local Deployment Guide (Windows)

VideoLingo offers multiple Whisper solutions for speech recognition (as there's no single perfect choice currently). Choose one based on your personal configuration and needs.

| Solution | Advantages | Disadvantages |
|:---------|:-----------|:--------------|
| **whisper_timestamped** | ‚Ä¢ Runs locally<br>‚Ä¢ Easy installation<br>‚Ä¢ Uses native Whisper model | ‚Ä¢ Ideal for English only<br>‚Ä¢ Requires GPU with 8GB+ VRAM |
| **whisperX**  | ‚Ä¢ Runs locally<br>‚Ä¢ Based on faster-whisper, excellent performance<br>‚Ä¢ Good multi-language support | ‚Ä¢ Requires CUDA and cuDNN installation<br>‚Ä¢ Separate wav2vec model download for each language<br>‚Ä¢ Requires GPU with 8GB+ VRAM |
| **whisperX_api** (üåüRecommended) | ‚Ä¢ Uses Replicate API, no local computing power needed | ‚Ä¢ Replicate service may be unstable, occasional CUDA errors<br>‚Ä¢ large-v3 model used may have inferior punctuation compared to v2 |

## üìã Preparation

1. Register an account on [Yunwu API](https://api.wlai.vip/register?aff=TXMB) and recharge to get a token (or use any claude-3.5-sonnet provider)
   > For best results, choose claude-3.5-sonnet. For testing, you can also select deepseek-coder, configure it later in the sidebar
