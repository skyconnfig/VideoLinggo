## üìã API Preparation

1. Obtain the API_KEY for large language models:

| Model | Recommended Provider | base_url | Price | Effect |
|:------|:---------------------|:---------|:------|:-------|
| claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620 | [yunwu API](https://yunwu.zeabur.app/register?aff=TXMB) | https://yunwu.zeabur.app | $2.14 / 1M | ü§© |
| Qwen/Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct | [Silicon Flow](https://cloud.siliconflow.cn/i/ttKDEsxE) | https://api.siliconflow.cn | $0.57 / 1M | üò≤ |

<summary><strong>How to choose a model?</strong></summary>
<p>By default, Qwen2.5 is used, costing about $0.43 for 1h video translation. Claude 3.5 has better results, with excellent translation coherence and no AI flavor, but it's more expensive.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary><strong>How to get an API key?</strong></summary>
<p>Register and top up with any large model provider, then create a new key on the API key page.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary><strong>Can I use other models?</strong></summary>
<p>OAI-Like API interfaces are supported, but you need to change it in the Streamlit sidebar. However, other models have weak ability to follow instructions and are very likely to cause errors during translation, so they are strongly discouraged.</p>
</details>

   - Register on [Replicate](https://replicate.com/account/api-tokens), bind Visa card payment method, and obtain token
